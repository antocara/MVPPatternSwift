# Basic sample application for a Login/Register with FireBase and Swift

For this example it has been used an approach to pattern Model View Presenter (or what I mean by this). The example is complete and can run on any emulator or device only downloading and compiling code.
CocoaPods has been used for dependencies (included in the repo)

The example uses a test account opened in FireBase, if you want to use your own just have to generate the GoogleService-Info.plist file from the FireBase console and replace the file that exists in the home directory of this example.

All feedback is welcome.

To do:

Add example login with:
* Google
* Facebook
* Github
* Twitter
* Firebase
